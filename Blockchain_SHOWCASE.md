### [ujo](https://ujomusic.com/)
**We’re building *a home for artists* that allows them to own and control their creative content and be paid directly for sharing their musical talents with the world**
> THE FUTURE: Today, an artist’s identity is thinly spread across many online music services. These platforms are walled-off and disconnected, making it difficult for innovators to access information that could be used to create services that allow fans to experience music in new ways. Ujo takes a different approach by building an open music ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain. The blockchain provides a shared infrastructure for all music services so they can focus on providing value to their users. The shared infrastructure also supplies a basis for persistent artist identity. Artists own and control their works, and can frictionlessly migrate to and from services.

A neutral backbone would be greatly beneficial for the music industry; however, adoption remains a challenge. To ignite the movement, we are building a fundamental service which is non-existent in the industry today: an artist-owned homepage. With this critical component, we can empower artists with direct payments, a closer connection to fans, and a home for their music that is wholly owned - not rented from online music services. This is just the first step in bringing to life a fair and healthy music industry fit for the digital age.

## HR, Labor, Freelance

### [ChronoBank](https://chronobank.io/) *TIME, LH: LHUS, LHUK, LHEU, LHAU*
**Blockchain revolution for the recruitment industry**
> ChronoBank.io is an ambitious and wide-ranging blockchain project, aimed at disrupting the HR/recruitment/finance industries in a similar way to how Uber disrupted the taxi business and how Upwork represented an evolution in freelancing. At ChronoBank.io, we are challenging the status quo and bringing an alternative to traditional financial systems. This alternative is a new generation of time-based currencies utilising the latest developments in blockchain technology. The first stage of our project is to create the financial backbone of ChronoBank.io: national Labour-Hour (LH) tokens.
LH are linked to average hourly wages in the host country and are backed by a real labour force from big recruitment and labour-hire companies. The second stage is to create LaborX, a decentralised marketplace where people in real-world professions will be able to sell labour-hours to anyone.

### [OTONOMOS](https://www.otonomos.com) *OBITS*
**EASY COMPANY INCORPORATION AND GOVERNANCE**
> Why I founded Otonomos
 Anybody who ever played with Lego knows that the fun is in the building: Few children play with what they built in Lego. The same goes for founders.  I managed to exit my last business just before Lehman collapsed.  It took me years to find an idea I knew dead certain I could spend the next decade of my life building. The idea came to me in summer 2014 whilst spending time in Silicon Valley, where I sensed an early movement to use distributed processing power to let anybody with access to a computer invest, borrow, contribute, shop, manufacture, vote, donate, spend and earn without the need for a central authority. It was this promise of a decentralised financial infrastructure for the future that prompted me to incorporate Otonomos in early 2015 upon my return to Singapore, and start building a team around the idea who would bring the same passion and dedication to executing it. Whilst no doubt there will be countless obstacles on our journey, all of us here at Otonomos are carried by this ideal of building what we believe will result in a new vehicle for human ingenuity. I hope you’ll follow Otonomos on its journey. Han, Founder & CEO
